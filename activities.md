> I'm responsible for making sure that our website works well and runs smoothly. This includes working with the development team to build and test the code, and making sure that everything is set up and running properly on the website. I also keep an eye on the website to find ways to make it better, and I fix any problems that come up. Another part of my job is to keep the website up and running all the time, and to make sure that it is always up to date and free of errors.



### Custom Domain for the Application
> I'm responsible for making sure that our group's website is easy to access and works well. To do this, I'll set up a custom domain for the website using a DNS, which is a system that helps people find our website online. I'll choose and buy a domain name that is related to our website, and then I'll set things up so that the domain name points to our server or IP address. I might also work with the development team to make sure that the DNS is set up and working correctly, and I'll keep an eye on the DNS to make sure it's running smoothly and providing fast and reliable access to our website and other online stuff. By taking care of the DNS, I'm helping to keep the website up and running all the time.
