# BackEnd Dev
<img src="{{site.baseurl}}/images/roughui.png">

Our goal here is to develop a usable application that can effectively take in a user's favorite movie and generate similar movies. In addition to that, the application should ideally be able to store the user's most favorite movies (as operated by user). When evaluating what movies are the most suitable for the user, we will be taking into account the genre, main cast, and potentially even the producer. 

> As the backend developer, my job is to successfully implement the "The Movie Database" API so that the millions of movies from around the world are stored in a directory and can be called upon whenever an inputted movie is "similar" to it. 


>As the backend developer, I have already created a team account in order to use their API. This database consists of millions of movies, including titles, overviews, ratings, and more. We are planning, as of this week, to get ready right away. We will be signing up for an API key, and from there, we will successfully be able to use the API key in order to make requests to the API to search for movies, retrieve movie data, and more.

I, along with my scrum master and team, have already begun to develop code for fetching movie data.

> Although it is still a work in progress, this code, once we use our API key, should be able to request to the The Movie Database (TMDb) API using the movie provided by the user and display the results in the list.
