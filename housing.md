## Brainstorming Features

### Samit
> I would like to incorporate a feature that provides the user with a link to the trailer of the movie which they are recommended to watch. This way, users will be given quick efficient access to get a preview of the movie before deciding whether they would like to watch it or not. This is mostly backend along with frontend, and as Scrum Master, I will do my best to help out as much as I can. 

### Martin
> As backend developer, I would like to create a feature that allows users to save their favorite movies to a watchlist and view the list later. This is a job largely for the frontend and backend, so I am up to the task. 

### Derek
> I am the frontend developer, and I want to add a feature that lets users rate the movies they have seen. This way, the recommendation for the movie already entails previous ratings for future movie-lovers to ponder. 

### Ethan
> Since Martin wants to add a feature for users to save their favorite movies, I want to add a feature that suggests similar movies based off the ones in the user's favorite list. This way, the input part can be skipped.
