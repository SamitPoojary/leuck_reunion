## The Idea

Our team's idea is to develop a web application that allows users to input their favorite movies and receive recommendations for similar movies. The application, ideally, should have a form (UI) that allows the user to enter the title of a movie they enjoyed greatly, and a button to submit the form. When the user submits the form, the application should use an API to retreive data about the user's movie, including elements such as its genre, length, producer, etc. The application should then display a list of similar movies to the user, along with their titles and brief descriptions about the film., and maybe even the genre. 

An example of a specific databse from which we can use as an API would be one known as The Movie Database. This API contains the information to millions of not just movies, but TV shows as well. 

The link below directs you to The Movie Database API home page, a database that contains the information and specificities to millions of movies worldwide. Our group plans on utilizing artificial intelligence in order to locate the similarities between the user's favorite movie and other movies that could potentially suit their interests as well. This database will better allow movie-lovers and movie critics to judge a movie based off of similar variants, overall enhancing the movie-watching experience and maybe even allow for better movies to be produced in the future.
